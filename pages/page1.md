## Project Overview

Smash Norge is an interest organization founded on voluntary work and community based effort. As their mission to grow Super Smash Bros. as a hobby and esport in Norway continues, I decided it was time their branding recieved a facelift. This project consists of a new logo and symbol, along with more saturated and contrasting colors for their profile.

## Logo

With the same base concept as the previous logo, the new logo features a more timely and modern design. The goal was to preserve the identity of Smash Norge, while also strengthening it with more saturated colors, stronger contrast, and thicker lines. The new logo has the benefit of being clearer and more recognizeable on all surfaces and in all sizes.

## Symbol

The new symbol for Smash Norge has the same idea as the previous one, while strengthening it’s design. Based on the Super Smash Bros. symbol, the Smash Norge symbol has some adjustments to make the white lines separating the blue cross and the red fill thicker, and more visible in smaller sizes. The symbol should never be used without it’s colors, which are based on the norwegian flag law of 1898, with slight adjustments to the saturation and lightness to allow larger contrast.

## Typography

A more presentable typeface was chosen for the logo. The typeface is Archivo, with the font being of the Black thickness. Already being used on Smash Norge’s new website (smashnorge.no), this typeface matches the logo in a very presentable manner. I also made a choice to go from uppercase to capitalized lowercase lettering for the logo, as the use of lowercase convey a casual and friendly message, while a fully uppercase logo often comes across as powerful and authoritarian. This has become a common trend in logo design throughout recent years.

## Spacing

The logo should always have the same spacing between symbol and type, while also retaining a good amount of space from other logos or the edges of the document.
